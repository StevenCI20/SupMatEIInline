"SM" is the supplementary material document of the article. It presents a detailed mathematical derivation
 of the phase retrieval for each X-ray phase contrast method. It also includes 
corresponding verifications with monochromatic Monte Carlo simulations, retrieving 
the projected thickness maps for each material. The "Data" file contains all the 
data in .raw format, organized into different files, such as the X-ray phase 
contrast method, voltage, distance or magnification, and plaque type. The 
"ProcCodes" file includes all the processing codes, from the conversion of 
the .raw files to .txt files (ProcIG4), the process to obtain the images 
(I_{+} and I_{-}) in Edge Illumination Single Mask by the Dithering steps 
(DitheringEI), and the codes for the phase retrieval for each method (Phase 
Retrieval EI-C.Beltran:EISM and Phase Retrieval II-C.Beltran:Inline). Additional 
codes show how we calculate the contrast-to-noise ratio in the different regions 
of interest and the data in the graphs shown in the main document. Finally, the 
"SimulationsG4Code" file contains the G4 codes to run the Monte Carlo simulations.
